MJML Readme
-----------

We use MJML to efficiently generate responsive HTML emails (see https://mjml.io). Specifically,
the .mjml files under the "mjml/email" directory are used to generate the .html files under the
"resources/email" directory.

Getting Started:

1) Learn MJML: https://documentation.mjml.io

2) Recommended tools: Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com) with MJML Plugin
   for WYSIWYG editing and syntax error highlighting
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmlio.vscode-mjml)

3) Compile MJML to HTML: https://mjml.io/try-it-live (select "Minify HTML").

4) Never modify .html files directly.
