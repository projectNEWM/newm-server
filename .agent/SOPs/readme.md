# 📝 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

> **Learn from experience. Document solutions. Prevent repeated mistakes.**

This folder contains Standard Operating Procedures — step-by-step guides for tasks that have been successfully completed or issues that have been resolved.

---

## Purpose

When the agent (or you) solves a complex problem or successfully integrates a service:

1. **Document the solution** — Create an SOP immediately
2. **Include pitfalls** — Note what went wrong and how it was fixed
3. **Make it reusable** — Future work on similar tasks should reference this

---

## How to Create a New SOP

Ask the agent:

> "Generate SOP for [task/integration name]"

Or manually create using the template below.

---

## SOP Template

```markdown
# SOP: [Task/Integration Name]

## When to Create an SOP

Create an SOP when:

- ✅ A complex integration is successfully completed
- ✅ A tricky bug is finally resolved
- ✅ A deployment issue is troubleshot
- ✅ A new service or tool is set up for the first time
- ✅ The same question/issue comes up multiple times

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** — Include exact commands, file paths, and configuration
2. **Include context** — Explain *why* steps are necessary, not just *what*
3. **Test the SOP** — Verify steps work by following them yourself
4. **Keep updated** — Revise when processes change
5. **Link related SOPs** — Cross-reference when tasks are related
