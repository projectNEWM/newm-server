# 📋 Task & Implementation History

> **Store successful PRDs and implementation plans for reference.**

This folder contains Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and implementation plans from completed features. Use these as templates and reference when implementing similar functionality.

---

## Purpose

Before implementing any feature:

1. **Check for similar past work** — Look for existing plans that match your task
2. **Use as templates** — Follow the same structure and patterns
3. **Ensure consistency** — Maintain architectural decisions across features

---

## How to Use

### Finding Relevant Plans

Plans are organized by feature domain:

```
.agent/task/
├── readme.md (this file)
├── songs/
│   └── audio-processing.md
├── earnings/
│   └── royalty-distribution.md
├── minting/
│   └── nft-minting-flow.md
└── cardano/
    └── wallet-integration.md
```

### Creating New Plans

When starting a new feature:

1. Ask the agent to run **"plan mode"**
2. Review and finalize the plan
3. Save the final plan in this folder under the appropriate domain

**Naming convention:**
```
{domain}/{feature-name}.md
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep plans updated** — Mark status changes as implementation progresses
2. **Link to PRs** — Reference the pull requests that implemented the plan
3. **Document deviations** — Note any changes from the original plan
4. **Include learnings** — Add retrospective notes for future reference
